# 10Question-form-XPath

This is a second version of the _10-Question-form_ repository where XML is accessed through XPath.
It also contains improved JS to enable new functions to check that all questions have been answered (whether correct or incorrectly)
Automatic correction triggers an XML transformation to show the table with options and answers.
Among the **options**, the correct ones are identified
Among the  given **answers** the correct ones are also flagged

JS provides a final score for the test
